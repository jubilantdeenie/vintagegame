This project was made as part of Udacity coursework for Exploring Javascript Tools. JavaScript functionality, updated graphics and a modal window have been added to the original content provided.

Use the up, down, left, and right arrow keys to direct your player to the water. Intersecting bugs will reset the game.  
 
## Attributions

The enemy-bug image has been modified using Gimp to create enemy-bug2. 

## Future Developments

Gems will be placed on the board to be collected by the player as they cross to the water.
